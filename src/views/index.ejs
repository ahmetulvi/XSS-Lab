<h1>Welcome to the XSS Vulnerability Lab!</h1>

<div class="info-box">
  <h3><i class="fas fa-flask"></i> About This Lab</h3>
  <p>
    This laboratory is designed to help you understand, exploit, and prevent
    common Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. XSS flaws occur whenever
    an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper
    validation or escaping, or updates an existing web page with user-supplied
    data using a browser API that can create HTML or JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>
    Navigate through the different types of XSS examples using the menu above.
    Each section provides both a vulnerable and a secured version of a scenario
    to help you learn by doing.

<div class="info-box">
  <h3><i class="fas fa-stream"></i> Types of XSS Covered</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Stored XSS (Persistent):</strong> Malicious scripts originate from
      the website's own database.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reflected XSS (Non-Persistent):</strong> Malicious scripts
      originate from the victim's request.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>DOM-Based XSS:</strong> The vulnerability exists in the
      client-side code rather than server-side code.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For each type, you'll find examples of vulnerable implementations and how
    they can be secured.
